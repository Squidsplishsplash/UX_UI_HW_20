      <div class="text-box">
        <p> To begin, I needed to identify my user and their pain-points. I started by creating a proto persona based on my assumptions. <br>
            I made a research plan to test these assumptions, broken down into three key objectives: <br>
            <br>
            Objective 1: Traveler Identities<br>
            Uncover participants’ motivations, hopes, fears, and roles when traveling and booking <br>
            <br>
            Objective 2: Planning process and tools<br>
            Learn how participants make their travel decisions<br>
            <br>
            Objective 3: Stories<br>
            Gather participant's past experiences and future expectations regarding travel<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Using my interview transcriptions, I gathered and organized the responses and thoughts of my participants. I used an affinity diagram to help pick out repeating patterns and themes amongst the data. This data was continually referenced through the rest of my design process.

        <p> I created a vivid and informed user persona named Lily out of the data. Her profile reflects a modern, flexible traveller looking to book a refreshing adventure.
            LEAP is designed with humans (and frogs) like Lily in mind. By getting into Lily's head, I could better empathize with my users and accommodate their needs and pain-points during the ideation and design process. </p>

<!--Jumbotron Problem Statement-->
<div class="jumbotron">
    <h1 class="display-4">The Problem</h1>
    <p class="lead">Travellers are frustrated by a repetitive search experience that forces them to narrow their horizons at the start.  Despite their flexibility, which should award them better deals and options, those seeking a spontaneous, budget-friendly trip struggle endlessly to find it.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>The Solution: LEAP is a travel-matchmaking platform that uses traveller’s unique desires and constraints to discover their perfect getaways.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">My Favourite Part</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The "I like, I wish, What If" brainstorming method is my favourite tool in the kit! It gives an open space for all the wildest ideas swirling around. In a group setting, it gives the dreamers an outlet and makes creative juices flow. I believe anything is possible and it's important to share a vision, even if we're not there yet.</p>

          <p class="card-text">A Feature Prioritization Matrix is my second favourite tool! This is the other side, when things start to come together and feel attainable. For me, I get a somewhat zen feeling as we hone in on the direction and find the roots of the product. Remembering everything is iterative and you need a solid place to start is a healthy and productive mindset to strive for.</p>

    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p> I started to envision what it might look like for Lily to find an exciting trip in her budget, without the endless frustration, wasted time, and second guessing that comes with her usual process. As I became aware of what Lily was feeling in her search for a getaway, a story came to life. I imagined how a journey can be a new beginning, and how the excitement should begin from the moment Lily sets out to plan it.</p>

  <div class="heading-box">
    <h3>User Flow</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p> I created a user flow to help plan out the paths a user might take when they find Leap. Many of my users had mentioned they wished someone would plan their trip for them, so I wanted to emulate the feeling of a travel agent and a matchmaking app working together to help the user find their ideal journey. I decided to make this clear at the start, and invite users for short interview/quiz to get to know their needs and preferences. </p>

        <h3>Wireframe Sketches</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p> Then came sketches of the first screens, which I hooked up into a prototype. This helped me swiftly bring the concept to life and enter a user testing phase.  I moved onto a low and mid-fi digital prototype and ran tests on the usability, ui, and overall flow as I went forward.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="text-box">
            <p> The user's priorities became more and more clear as I tested, and I adapted the product accordingly as I moved into a low-fi digital prototype.

                I found aside from small navigational and UI considerations to be made, users were concerned if the solution was trustworthy. Will it really work for the users and honour their preferences? How do they know they can trust their matches are really the best? How will they know the recommendations are safe and comfortable.</p>

                <li>Develop the “explore tool” - a date & location-flexible flight searching tool which, similar to google flights, can search the world for the best deals in any time frame. Results can be filtered by travel personas, interests, goals, and all preferences and constraints mentioned in the persona-creation quiz</li>
                <li>Prototype is currently flights only - how will stays and activities could be integrated into the app?</li>
                <li>Add a social element where verified users can share thoughts and images from similarly matched trips. May include the possibility to allow private messaging or public question and responses (similar to amazon user Q&As and google guides) - Though unnecessary for the early prototype, the username creation field was added with this social element in mind</li>
